        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>
            By adding or using the PingMan discord bot (the “Bot”) created and operated by milkry (the “Developer”), you
            agree to be
            bound by the following terms and conditions (the “Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not
            add or use
            the Bot. In the event of a breach in the Terms, the Developer has every right to revoke your access to the
            Bot with or
            without notice.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You agree that any intentional command spam or attempts to crash the Bot are prohibited and
                    can
                    result in
                    your access
                    being revoked.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The Developer reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Bot or these Terms at any
                    time
                    and
                    for any
                    reason, with or without notice. You agree to periodically review these Terms for any changes or
                    updates.
                    Your continued
                    use of or access to the Bot after any such modification, suspension, or termination constitutes
                    your
                    acceptance of these
                    Terms as modified.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    You agree to use the Bot in a non-malicious, respectful, and appropriate manner, and not to
                    spam,
                    harass,
                    or abuse
                    anyone with the Bot.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The Developer disclaims all liability for any damages, losses, costs, or expenses arising from
                    or
                    relating to your
                    use of or inability to use the Bot, including but not limited to any errors, bugs, or
                    malfunctions
                    that may
                    affect the
                    Bot.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    You agree to use the Bot in accordance with the Discord Terms of Service, the Discord Community

                <p>
                    These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Developer regarding your use of
                    and
                    access to the
                    Bot. These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Cyprus. Any
                    disputes
                    arising
                    from or
                    relating to these Terms or the Bot shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
                    of
                    Cyprus.
